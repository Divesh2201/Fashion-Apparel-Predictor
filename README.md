A Neural Network model that predicts the type of clothing / apparel by learning through train images.

### Language: Python3
### Library: Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras
### Dataset: Fashion_mnist

A gist from the model training itself on 60000 samples...

Then the model Predicts on 10000 test image samples which it has not seen before...

And then we can verify on the test images and the models predictions...

This is my first project with tensorflow 2.0 and I'm pretty excited to build more models using the library :)
